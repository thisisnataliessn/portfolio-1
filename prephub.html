                        prep for class. Content is spread out in different shared folders, in emailed links, or in
                        unsorted
                        lists of bookmarks in browsers. And with constant curriculum updates, it's hard to know which
                        files
                        are relevant.</p>

                    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

                    <p>Based on my user research, I found most teachers already used cloud storage. Therefore, my
                        service
                        would need to feel familiar. However, I found three key ways that cloud storage could be
                        optimized
                        for teachers: <br><br>

                        <b class="number">1. </b>Add explicit <b class="black-bold">URL saving functionality</b> for
                        teachers to access
                        all their digital prep
                        materials in
                        one place.</p>

                    <p><b class="number">2. </b>Make an obvious option to <b class="black-bold">password protect</b>
                        the shared links for
                        files.
                    </p>
                    <p><b class="number">3. </b>Offer an obvious way to <b class="black-bold">keep relevant files on
                            top</b>, unlike any
                        competitor.</p>

                    <p class="letter"><b class="number">a. </b>Sorting files by the “last used” date would allow
                        teachers to group files by dates they
                        taught
                        certain classes, keeping the most relevant files on top. If outdated files from old curriculum
                        remain on the cloud, teachers could look at the “last used” date to avoid time opening several
                        files, hunting for the right one.<br> </p>

                    <p class="letter"><b class="number">b. </b>The “last used” date could also be used by
                        administrators of schools/districts to

                        what

                        a prototype with InVision and administered user testing both in-person and remotely (via screen
                        sharing on Skype).<br>

                        While users completed most tasks successfully, I learned from testing that several design
                        aspects weren't as intuitive as I expected. So, I made several changesto improve usability. The
                        biggest changes included:
                    </p>
                    <p class="wf-text"><b class="number">1. </b>Making an ellipsis menu available on every line item on
                        the dashboard,
                        without needing to
                        hover
                        over it</p>
                    <p class="wf-text"><b class="number">2. </b>
                        Adding a “Used Today” checkbox in every column to make updating the “last used” date easier
                        and
                        more obvious than hiding it in the ellipsis menu</p>
                    <p class="wf-text"><b class="number">3. </b>
                        Adding names and locations for teachers cited in the testimonials, so they seem more
                        real/relatable</p>
                    </ul>

                            serious about the look and feel of the brand. I wanted my brand to convey ease and
                            straightforwardness. I also wanted it to be as
                            clear as possible from first glance for whom and what the website was intended.</p>
                    </div>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <div class="branding-details-container">
                        <p> I settled on the <b class="black-bold">name</b> PrepHub because “hub” means “the effective
                            center of an
                            activity,
                            region, or network” and I wanted my website to be the effective host (or center) of all
                            prep
                            materials. The <b class="black-bold">logo</b> conveys the hub aspect, with the center apple
                            clearly
                            representing
                            teachers as its intended audience.<br><br>

                            The <b class="black-bold">color scheme</b> feels like an elementary school environment. I
                            chose Lato as my
                            typeface
                            because it felt contemporary and easy-to-read.<br><br>

                            My working brand <b class="black-bold">typeface</b> was Oswald, but one user pointed out
                            they would expect an
                            open, circular
                            serif style to go along with the elementary school vibe. Since Lato met those needs and
                            matched
                            the
                            body typeface, it was a shoe-in. To ensure consistency and adherence to these ideas across
                            all
                            parts of the project, I also made a style guide.

                        several preference tests on it using UsabilityHub.

                    <p class="pref-test-descrip">First, I tested <b class="black-bold">photos vs illustrations</b>.
                        With only a 5% difference in opinions, I used testers' comments to determine <b class="black-bold">graphics
                            worked
                            better </b>. Users noted
                        graphics
                        matched the logo aesthetics, felt more modern, and that the photos were too abstract for

                            the
                            project, I doubted that I would be able to come up with a strong brand identity since I
                            don’t have a
                            background in art. However, I learned that sketching and mindmapping are extremely valuable
                            brainstorming tools that should not be overlooked. I am extremely pleased with the look of
                            feel
                            of
                            the PrepHub brand, especially its logo and name; it is clean and clearly conveys the site’s
                            audience and purpose.</p>
                        <p class="conc-p2"><b class="number">2. </b>
                            As
                            a
                            former
                            teacher myself, I thought I had a pretty good idea of what teachers needed in cloud
                            storage. However, through user testing, I quickly realized I needed to stop assuming I knew
                            what was best for every user. I witnessed how every user has a different approach to
                            navigating user interfaces. By basing every iteration off of user feedback, PrepHub's
                            design is more useful than I could've ever imagined. I truly wish it had existed when I was
                            teaching.</p>
                        <p class="conc-p3"> <b class="number">3. </b>In thinking about further development, I would
                            like more testing

                            from
                            my target

                            is
                            opportunity for PrepHub to create its own teacher-focused creative software (for documents,

                            decks, etc.) through further research, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing. </p>
