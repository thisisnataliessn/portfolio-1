                    <hr>
                    <p>Current cloud storage services are not streamlined for the kind of organization teachers need to
                        prep for class. Content is spread out in different shared folders, in emailed links, or in
                        unsorted
                        lists of bookmarks in browsers. And with constant curriculum updates, it's hard to know which
                        files
                        are relevant.</p>

                    <p>PrepHub offers teachers a familiar feel for cloud storage while providing more tailored features
                        to
                        meet their needs. It offers teachers a way to centralize all kinds of prep material, to bring
                        relevant material to the top, and to enable password restriction on shareable links.</p>

                    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Based on my user research, I found most teachers already used cloud storage. Therefore, my
                        service
                        would need to feel familiar. However, I found three key ways that cloud storage could be
                        optimized
                        for teachers: <br><br>

                        1) Add explicit URL saving functionality for teachers to access all their digital prep
                        materials in
                        one place<br><br>

                        2) Make password saving an obvious choice on the Shareable Link modal window
                    </p>
                    <p>3) Offer an obvious way to keep relevant files on top, unlike any competitor.<br>

                        <br>a) Sorting files by the “last used” date would allow teachers to group files by dates they
                        taught
                        certain classes, keeping the most relevant files on top. If outdated files from old curriculum
                        remain on the cloud, teachers could look at the “last used” date to avoid time opening several
                        files, hunting for the right one.<br>

                        <br>b) The “last used” date could also be used by administrators of schools/districts to determine
                        what
                        files their teachers are using the most

                    <hr>
                    <p>With flows in place, I began sketching rough wireframes for PrepHub. After some A/B testing with
                        a design mentor for the landing page, I created hi-fi wireframes using Figma. I turned these
                        into
                        a prototype with InVision and administered user testing both in-person and remotely (via screen
                        sharing on Skype).<br><br>

                        While users completed most tasks successfully, I learned from testing that several design
                        aspects weren't as intuitive as I expected. So, I made several changesto improve usability. The
                        biggest changes included:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Making an ellipsis menu available on every line item on the dashboard, without needing to
                            hover
                            over it</li>
                        <li>Adding a “Used Today” checkbox in every column to make updating the “last used” date easier
                            and
                            more obvious than hiding it in the ellipsis menu</li>
                        <li> Adding names and locations for teachers cited in the testimonials, so they seem more
                            real/relatable</li>
                        </ol>

                        user flows served as the foundations for my wireframes.</p>

                    <img>
                    <p> I settled on the <b>name</b> PrepHub because “hub” means “the effective center of an activity,
                        region, or network” and I wanted my website to be the effective host/center of all teachers’
                        prep
                        materials. The <b>logo</b> conveys the hub aspect, with the center apple clearly representing
                        teachers as
                        its intended audience.<br>

                        The <b>color scheme</b> feels like an elementary school environment. I chose Lato as my
                        typeface
                        because it felt contemporary and easy-to-read.<br>

                        My working brand <b>typeface</b> was Oswald, but one user pointed out they would expect an
                        open, circular
                        serif style to go along with the elementary school vibe. Since Lato met those needs and matched
                        the
                        body typeface, it was a shoe-in. To ensure consistency and adherence to these ideas across all
                        parts of the project, I also made a style guide. <br>

                    <hr>
                    <p>I wanted to ensure my landing page, the first page people saw, left the best impression, so I
                        did
                        several preference tests on it using UsabilityHub. First I tested photos vs illustrations. But
                        with
                        only a 5% difference, I used comments to determine which was better. Users noted graphics
                        worked
                        better with the logo aesthetics, felt more modern, and photos were too abstract for this
                        scenario.
                        I also tested a few different layout combinations for the testimonials and plans sections.</p>

                    <h2>Hi-fi Mockups & Testing</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Finally, I turned my hi-fi mockups into a prototype on InVision and tested five users, both
                        in-person and remotely. I made the following discoveries from the tests:<br>

                        1) I needed more spacing and color in my left nav bar. <br>

                        2) I needed to clarify the wording in the modal windows for shared links and opening a doc,
                        xls, or
                        ppt in Open Office.<br>
                        3) Some users prefer grid view so I added this view option.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4) The “Used Today” checkbox was self-explanatory to users, but when asked to enter several
                        dates
                        on which a file was used, users tended to gravitate toward the “Last Used” column. I realized
                        from
                        this I would need a couple changes: <br>
                        a) I implemented a hover state of the “Last Used” title to bring up a small box explaining what
                        it
                        means. <br>
                        b) I would ask development to enable right clicks to open the ellipsis menu wherever clicked,
                        and a
                        double-click in the “Last Used” column to open the “Enter Date(s) Used” modal window.

                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                <hr>
                <p class="conc-p1">PrepHub was a large undertaking, but one with many lessons for me. Going into the
                    project, I was
                    doubtful that I would be able to come up with a strong brand identity since I don’t have a
                    background in art. However, I learned that sketching and mindmapping are extremely valuable
                    brainstorming tools that should not be overlooked. I am extremely pleased with the look of feel
                    of
                    the PrepHub brand, especially its logo and name; it is clean and clearly conveys the site’s
                    audience and purpose.</p>
                <p class="conc-p2">Most importantly, PrepHub accomplishes its goal of helping teachers stay organized
                    and spend
                    less
                    time prepping. I based every iteration on feedback from users, including real teachers. As a
                    former
                    teacher myself, I would have loved to have this service available. </p>
                <p class="conc-p3">In thinking about further development, I would like more testing participants from
                    my target
                    audience to ensure every detail is as intuitive as possible. Additionally, I believe there is
                    opportunity for PrepHub to create its own teacher-focused creative software (for documents,
                    slide
                    decks, etc.) through further research, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing. /p>
