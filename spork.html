                        <p>Ever sat down at a restaurant and thought to yourself, “Man! I wish I could remember what I
                            had last time I came here! Was it even good?” Or ever wished you could remember that place
                            where you and your friend ate a couple months ago? Spork is here to help.</p>

                        <h2>Solution</h2>
                        <p>Spork allows users to track (or “spork”) each restaurant visit. By entering things like the
                            date, restaurant, whom they ate with, and ranking each menu item they tried, users can not
                            only remember what they want to, but they can also see statistical insights about their
                            overall dining habits. And who knows? Maybe by seeing what you’ve already tried, you’ll be
                            inspired to try some new dish or restaurant next time.</p>

                <div class="headline user-surveys">
                    <h2>User Surveys</h2>
                    <p>The idea for this app came about from one friend mentioning he wished there were an app similar
                        to BG Stats (an app that tracks board game plays) for eating out with friends. While it sounded
                        like a great idea from the get-go, I needed to make sure there was actual interest in it. So, I
                        conducted a survey that targeted anyone who likes eating out and learned the following.<br>
                        <br>
                        Over 50% of respondents said they sometimes or often <b>wish they could remember</b>:</p>
                    <div class="circles-container">
                        <div class="circle stat-1">
                            <h3>60%</h3>
                            <p>what they ordered the last time they went to a restaurant</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="circle stat-2">
                            <h3>57%</h3>
                            <p>if they actually liked the item they ordered</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="circle stat-3">
                            <h3>54%</h3>
                            <p>the last time they ate at a certain restaurant</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Next, I introduced a hypothetical app for tracking restaurant visits and asked users what
                        features would be useful. This really shaped my MVP.</p><img
                        alt="list of features by popularity" class="shadow persona"
                        src="images/spork/useful-features.png">
                    <p>I also learned that most users (92%) would want an app that implemented <b>predictive text based
                            on location</b> to find nearby restaurants. Through various comments in the survey, I also
                        discovered <b>compiled statistics</b> were an attractive feature for this potential app.<br>
                        <br>
                        After introducing users through the above questions to what this app could be, I asked the most
                        telling question of all:</p><img
                        alt="graph showing over 80% of respondents were interested in app" class="shadow persona"
                        src="images/spork/overall-interest.png">
                    <p>With over 80% of respondents somewhat interested or very interested, there was no longer any
                        doubt in my mind that this was an app worth creating.</p>

                            familiar and intuitive. Here are some of my key takeaways:</p>
                        <p><b class="number">1.</b> There is a great opportunity for Spork to enter the market. The
                            following apps all let users mark places they've been, but greatly limit the amount of
                            details one can add about each visit. Additionally, users can often only mark one visit to
                            that location, making it impossible to visually compare each of their visits. Spork would
                            take what exists to the next level in terms of <b>number of details tracked</b>.</p>

                            However, I wanted an app that felt less like a simple interface for interpreting spreadsheet
                            data. I wanted my app to have <b>a more pleasing visual aesthetic</b>, even when users
                            looked at their statistcs. While Spork still has a way to go to be as visual, Polarsteps was
                            a huge inspiration to show how aesthetically appealing statistics could be.</p>

                            on my designs. Since users of Spork would have the option to rank two different things (menu
                            item taste and overall visit experience), it became important to differentiate the two

                    <p class="wf-text">Using my user flows and stories as guideposts, I sketched out some wireframes and
                        put them through user testing. I wanted as must user input as possible before spending time
                        digitizing my wireframes. I ended up with three different iterations of just my sketches. My
                        biggest takeaways from these tests were:</p>
                    <div class="first-half-size">
                        <p><b class="number">1.</b> Lots of people love taking pictures of their food. As such, the "Add
                            Photo" option shouldn't be a buried option, but stand out on the first page.</p>
                        <p><b class="number">2.</b> Stars aren't the right way to rate the taste of food. One user
                            explained his reaction to food is almost emotionally felt. When I asked testers if emojis
                            would convey reactions to food better, they all liked the idea.</p>
                        <p><b class="number">3.</b> There should be a separate way to rate the visit (for service,
                            ambiance, etc.), not just the taste of the food.</p>

                            in a visual way. Interesting personal dining statistics would be more fun to see than just a
                            list of restaurants they visited. A couple users really wanted the app "gameified" by adding
                            achievements like trying every Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood. Adding a home screen
                            with pulled-out statistics was a good start for my MVP, and eventually, would be a good
                            place to get users excited about different "missions" to earn achievements.</p>
                        <p><b class="number">5.</b> An easily visible bottom app bar was much more intuitive than
                            navigation buried in a hamburger menu.</p>

                    <p>I incorporated the above feedback and created some digital wireframes. I user tested and iterated
                        on these as well. I'm really glad I did, too, because there were a few key changes I needed to
                        make before I spent time refining them into hi-fi mockups.</p>
                    <p><b class="number">1.</b> The thing people want to track most (the menu item they tried) didn't
                        make sense to put on a separate page. Adding the <b>name, picture, and rating of the menu
                            item(s) they tried</b> was the most important thing to testers, so I realized it should be
                        the first thing they are able to enter when they "Spork a visit." They shouldn't have to
                        navigate to a different page to enter these details.</p>

                        skimming large pictures is a lot easier than a bunch of text with a tiny thumbnail. So I
                        completely <b>redesigned the Visits page to highlight photos</b>. I also realized if they wanted
                        to search quickly, the list items should <b>include the menu items' rankings</b>. I experimented
                        including whom people ate with, but most users didn't feel this was that important and that it
                        added too many words.</p>

                    <h2>Identity Creation</h2>
                    <p class="wf-text">After refining my wireframes, it was time to figure out what the look, feel, and
                        name of the app would be. This was a struggle because I wanted to come up with a name that
                        helped explain what the app did, but also really liked the idea of a short, catchy name.</p>
                    <p class="wf-text">At first I toyed with the names Dinary (a portmanteau of “dining diary”),
                        NomNotes, or Plate Rate. But I found all of these either failed short of encapsulating what my
                        app did, or just didn’t sound very good. When the name Spoke came to me, I initially dismissed
                        it because it said nothing of what the app was for. But then I considered Yelp, Google, and
                        Foursquare--none of which have a title explaining the company’s purpose.</p>
                    <p class="wf-text">So I asked friends for their opinions on what the name should be. Ultimately, we
                        agreed Spork would be a great name for a restaurant app and were all surprised it didn’t exist
                        already. We loved that it worked well to verb-ify as in, “Give me a second. I need to Spork this
                        [restaurant visit].” It also made deciding on a logo a million times easier since the name is a
                        physical object.</p>
                    <p class="wf-text">After experimenting with lots of logos, my final decision was based off of
                        preference tests with friends and other students at Bloc.</p>
                    <p class="wf-text">For colors, I knew I wanted to use red or yellow both colors often associated
                        with restaurants / food. I chose my dark orange-red because it felt foody and worked well with
                        white type on top of it (a common trend in Material Design, which I used as guidelines for much
                        of my styling). The blue came from experimenting with what went well with red that could be a
                        background to white text. Green felt too Christmas-y.</p>

                    <p><b class="number">3.</b> Having a different view options between a list and pie chart view seemed
                        like the smartest way to make everyone happy in the way data was presented. The biggest
                        questions was what the most intuitive way of <b>switching the views</b> would be. In preference
                        testing
                        three options, I found that 76% of testers preferred the toggle beneath the tabs. You can see
                        the new design also features better <b>adherence to Material Design guidelines</b> below the
                        photo carousel.</p><br>

                    <p><b class="number">4.</b> With the "Spork a visit" page feeling long, I wondered if I should
                        separate the sections. Sure enough, after preference testing the screens below, I found the
                        majority of users (70%) preferred <b>each section having a clear anchor</b>. About
                        35% preferred the single lines of background and another 35% preferred the longer colored
                        backgrounds. You can also see here the change I made to the <b>"add a photo" icon</b>, based on
                        user testing observations that the picture frame icon wasn't clear.

                    <div class="conc-p">
                        <p>Besides basic takeaways about how people use apps, I learned a lot from designing Spork that
                            I intend to apply to future design projects:</p>
                        <p><b class="number">1.</b> It’s worth it to investigate apps that aren’t direct competitors.
                            When doing my competitive analysis I should’ve have looked up other apps that track anything
                            (not just traveling, restaurants, or board games). I found out about Untappd and aTimeLogger
                            after mostly completing the design of my app.</p>
                        <p><b class="number">2.</b> It’s okay to add questions to a survey shortly after it’s been
                            deployed. I added “Photos of meal” as an option after several people had already taken the
                            survey, and still had 59.5% of all respondents (including the initial takers who didn’t see
                            the option) select this feature. If I hadn’t added that option later, I might not have
                            realized until much later, after designing and testing wireframes, how important photos
                            were.</p>
                        <p><b class="number">3.</b> When it comes to user testing, more than notes are needed. I
                            realized after taking notes on the first four tests that it would be tricky to try to comb
                            through the notes to compare where users experienced similar things. I wanted a more
                            systematic approach to analyzing user testing feedback, especially because I intended to do
                            lots of user testing for this project. I found a great spreadsheet on <a
                                href="https://medium.com/cafe-pixo/a-practical-way-to-organize-usability-test-insights-c6fb24cd5d1"
                                target="_blank">Medium</a> that I modified slightly. I took the time after each test to
                            record my observations (or mark if they were repeated). You can see my final user testing
                            spreadsheet <a
                                href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sYpeSablwSsedJurypqvf3z6FGKZUngR4c7P2xRfXQc/edit?usp=sharing"
                                target="_blank">here</a>. While improvements could still be made to how I organize my
                            findings, especially if I were to present them to stakeholders, this spreadsheet was a huge
                            help to prioritizing changes. I will definitely continue to take extra time to organize user
                            testing observations and look forward to refining my process even further.</p>
                        <p><b class="number">4.</b> It’s important to develop more screens than might feel necessary for
                            prototypes, like a blank log-in screen and one that filled out so users understand they’re
                            not actually typing anything. When search fields are included, it’s also important to show
                            users how it would work so you can get feedback on it.</p>
                        <p><b class="number">5.</b> It’s important to set reminders to check back consistently at user
                            personas. I thought I just remembered everything about them as I was designing, but when I
                            had finished designing, I saw that I was mistaken. One of my personas biggest frustrations
                            was not being able to share his statistics with friends from within the BG Stats app.
                            Fortunately, shareability didn’t come up during the user surveys; it was mentioned only in
                            one user interview. While this is easy to just write off as “not being part of the MVP”,
                            completely forgetting about it showed me the importance of continually checking my design
                            against my personas.</p>
