                        <p>Ever sat down at a restaurant and thought to yourself, “Man! I wish I could remember what I
                            had
                            last time I came here! Was it even good?” Or ever wished you could remember that place where
                            you
                            and your friend ate a couple months ago? Spork is here to help.</p>

                        <p>Spork allows users to track (or “spork”) each restaurant visit. By entering things like the
                            date,
                            restaurant, whom they ate with, and ranking each menu item they tried, users can not only
                            remember what they want to, but they can also see statistical insights about their overall
                            dining habits. And who knows? Maybe by seeing what you’ve already tried, you’ll be inspired
                            to
                            try some new dish or restaurant next time.</p>

                    <h2>User Surveys</h2>

                    <p>
                        The idea for this app came about from one friend mentioning he wished there were an app similar
                        to BG Stats (an app that tracks board game plays) for eating out with friends. While it sounded
                        like a great idea from the get-go, I needed to make sure there was actual interest in it. So, I
                        conducted a survey that targeted anyone who likes eating out and learned the following.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Over 50% of respondents said they sometimes or often wish they could remember:
                    </p>
                    <div class="circles-container">
                        <div class="circle stat-1">
                            <h3>60%</h3>
                            <p>what they ordered the last time they went to a restaurant</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="circle stat-2">
                            <h3>57%</h3>
                            <p>if they actually liked the item they ordered</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="circle stat-3">
                            <h3>54%</h3>
                            <p>the last time they ate at a certain restaurant</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Next, I introduced a hypothetical app for tracking restaurant visits and asked users what
                        features
                        would be useful.
                        This really shaped my MVP.</p>
                    <img class="shadow persona" src="images/spork/useful-features.png"
                        alt="list of features by popularity">
                    <p>I also learned that most users (92%) would want an app
                        that implemented predictive text based on location to find
                        nearby restaurants. Through various comments in the survey, I also discovered compiled
                        statistics were an attractive feature for this
                        potential app.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        After
                        introducing users through the above questions to what this app could be, I asked the most
                        telling question of all:
                    </p>
                    <img class="shadow persona" src="images/spork/overall-interest.png"
                        alt="graph showing over 80% of respondents were interested in app">
                    <p>With
                        over 80% of respondents
                        somewhat interested or very interested, there was no longer any doubt in my mind
                        that this was an app worth creating.</p>

                    <p class="wf-text">With flows in place, I began sketching rough wireframes for PrepHub. After some
                        A/B testing with
                        a design mentor for the landing page, I created hi-fi wireframes using Figma. I turned these
                        into
                        a prototype with InVision and administered user testing both in-person and remotely (via screen
                        sharing on Skype).<br><br>

                        While users completed most tasks successfully, I learned from testing that several design
                        aspects weren't as intuitive as I expected. So, I made several changes to improve usability. The
                        biggest changes included:
                    </p>
                    <p class="wf-text"><b class="number">1. </b>Making an ellipsis menu available on every line item on
                        the dashboard,
                        without needing to
                        hover
                        over it</p>
                    <p class="wf-text"><b class="number">2. </b>
                        Adding a “Used Today” checkbox in every column to make updating the “last used” date easier
                        and
                        more obvious than hiding it in the ellipsis menu</p>
                    <p class="wf-text"><b class="number">3. </b>
                        Adding names and locations for teachers cited in the testimonials, so they seem more
                        real/relatable</p>

                            straightforwardness. I also wanted it to be as
                            clear as possible from first glance for whom and what the website was intended.</p>

                    <div class="branding-details-container">
                        <p> I settled on the <b class="black-bold">name</b> PrepHub because “hub” means “the effective
                            center of an
                            activity,
                            region, or network” and I wanted my website to be the effective host (or center) of all
                            prep
                            materials. The <b class="black-bold">logo</b> conveys the hub aspect, with the center apple
                            clearly
                            representing
                            teachers as its intended audience.<br><br>

                            The <b class="black-bold">color scheme</b> feels like an elementary school environment. I
                            chose Lato as my
                            typeface
                            because it felt contemporary and easy-to-read.<br><br>

                            My working brand <b class="black-bold">typeface</b> was Oswald, but one user pointed out
                            they would expect an
                            open, circular
                            serif style to go along with the elementary school vibe. Since Lato met those needs and
                            matched
                            the
                            body typeface, it was a shoe-in. To ensure consistency and adherence to these ideas across
                            all
                            parts of the project, I also made a style guide.

                        the wording in the modal windows for shared links and opening a doc,
                        xls, or ppt in Open Office.</p><br><br>

                        dates
                        on which a file was used, users tended to gravitate toward the “Last Used” column. I realized
                        from
                        this I would need a couple changes:</p>
                    <p class="letter"><b class="number">a. </b>I implemented a hover state of the “Last Used” title to
                        bring up a small box explaining what
                        it
                        means. </p><br>

                        the ellipsis menu wherever clicked,
                        and a
                        double-click in the “Last Used” column to open the “Enter Date(s) Used” modal window.

                        <p> <b class="number">1. </b> Going
                            into
                            the
                            project, I doubted that I would be able to come up with a strong brand identity since I
                            don’t have a
                            background in art. However, I learned that sketching and mindmapping are extremely valuable
                            brainstorming tools that should not be overlooked. I am extremely pleased with the look of
                            feel
                            of
                            the PrepHub brand, especially its logo and name; it is clean and clearly conveys the site’s
                            audience and purpose.</p>
                        <p><b class="number">2. </b>
                            As
                            a
                            former
                            teacher myself, I thought I had a pretty good idea of what teachers needed in cloud
                            storage. However, through user testing, I quickly realized I needed to stop assuming I knew
                            what was best for every user. I witnessed how every user has a different approach to
                            navigating user interfaces. By basing every iteration off of user feedback, PrepHub's
                            design is more useful than I could've ever imagined. I truly wish it had existed when I was
                            teaching.</p>
                        <p> <b class="number">3. </b>In thinking about further development, I would
                            like more testing
                            participants
                            from
                            my target
                            audience to ensure every detail is as intuitive as possible. I also believe there
                            is
                            opportunity for PrepHub to create its own teacher-focused creative software (for documents,
                            slide
                            decks, etc.) through further research, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing. </p>
