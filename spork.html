                        <p>Ever sat down at a restaurant and thought to yourself, “Man! I wish I could remember what I
                            had
                            last time I came here! Was it even good?” Or ever wished you could remember that place where
                            you
                            and your friend ate a couple months ago? Spork is here to help.</p>

                        <p>Spork allows users to track (or “spork”) each restaurant visit. By entering things like the
                            date,
                            restaurant, whom they ate with, and ranking each menu item they tried, users can not only
                            remember what they want to, but they can also see statistical insights about their overall
                            dining habits. And who knows? Maybe by seeing what you’ve already tried, you’ll be inspired
                            to
                            try some new dish or restaurant next time.</p>

                    <h2>User Surveys</h2>

                    <p>
                        The idea for this app came about from one friend mentioning he wished there were an app similar
                        to BG Stats (an app that tracks board game plays) for eating out with friends. While it sounded
                        like a great idea from the get-go, I needed to make sure there was actual interest in it. So, I
                        conducted a survey that targeted anyone who likes eating out and learned the following.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Over 50% of respondents said they sometimes or often <b>wish they could remember</b>:
                    </p>
                    <div class="circles-container">
                        <div class="circle stat-1">
                            <h3>60%</h3>
                            <p>what they ordered the last time they went to a restaurant</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="circle stat-2">
                            <h3>57%</h3>
                            <p>if they actually liked the item they ordered</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="circle stat-3">
                            <h3>54%</h3>
                            <p>the last time they ate at a certain restaurant</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Next, I introduced a hypothetical app for tracking restaurant visits and asked users what
                        features
                        would be useful.
                        This really shaped my MVP.</p>
                    <img class="shadow persona" src="images/spork/useful-features.png"
                        alt="list of features by popularity">
                    <p>I also learned that most users (92%) would want an app
                        that implemented <b>predictive text based on location</b> to find
                        nearby restaurants. Through various comments in the survey, I also discovered <b>compiled
                            statistics</b> were an attractive feature for this
                        potential app.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        After
                        introducing users through the above questions to what this app could be, I asked the most
                        telling question of all:
                    </p>
                    <img class="shadow persona" src="images/spork/overall-interest.png"
                        alt="graph showing over 80% of respondents were interested in app">
                    <p>With
                        over 80% of respondents
                        somewhat interested or very interested, there was no longer any doubt in my mind
                        that this was an app worth creating.</p>

                        <p>While awaiting survey responses, I looked at Spork's potential competition.
                            There are incredibly no direct competitors to this app, but I still wanted to make sure it
                            felt
                            familiar and
                            intuitive. Here are some of my key takeaways:
                        </p>
                        <p><b class="number">1. </b>There is a great opportunity for Spork to enter the market. The
                            following apps
                            all
                            let users mark places they've been, but greatly limit the amount of details one can add
                            about
                            each visit. Additionally, users can often only mark one visit to that location, making it
                            impossible to visually compare each of their visits. Spork would take what exists to the
                            next level in terms of <b>number of details tracked</b>.</p>

                            However, I
                            wanted an app that felt less like a simple interface for interpreting spreadsheet data. I
                            wanted
                            my app to have <b>a more pleasing visual aesthetic</b>, even when users looked at their

                            While Spork still has a
                            way to go to be as visual, Polarsteps was a huge inspiration to show how aesthetically

                            There were a lot of great ideas, but I needed to try to keep scope creep to a

                <p class="wf-text">Using my user flows and stories as guideposts, I sketched out some wireframes and
                    put them through user testing. I wanted as must user input as possible before spending time
                    digitizing my wireframes.
                    I ended up with three different iterations of just my sketches. My biggest takeaways
                    from these tests were:
                </p>
                <p><b class="number">1. </b>Lots of people love taking pictures of their food. As such,
                    the "Add Photo" option shouldn't be a buried option, but stand out on the first page.</p>
                <p><b class="number">2. </b>
                    Stars aren't the right way to rate the taste of food. One user explained his reaction to food is
                    almost emotionally felt. When I asked testers if emojis would convey reactions to food better, they
                    all liked the idea.</p>
                <p><b class="number">3. </b>
                    There should be a separate way to rate the visit (for service, ambiance, etc.), not just the taste
                    of the food.</p>

                <p><b class="number">4. </b>
                    The landing page for returning users should convey fun information in a visual way. Interesting
                    personal dining statistics would be more fun to see than just a list of restaurants they visited. A
                    couple
                    users really wanted the app "gameified" by adding achievements like trying every Mexican
                    restaurant in the neighborhood. Adding a home screen with pulled-out statistics was a good
                    start for my MVP, and eventually, would be a good place to get users excited about different
                    "missions" to earn achievements.
                </p>
                <p><b class="number">5. </b>
                    An easily visible bottom app bar was much more intuitive than navigation buried in a hamburger menu.

                <p class="wf-text">I incorporated the above feedback and created some digital wireframes. I user tested

                <p><b class="number">1. </b>It should have come as no surprise to me that the people who like to take
                    pictures of their food also want to be able to easily scroll through those photos. Quickly skimming
                    large pictures is a lot easier than a bunch of text with a tiny thumbnail. So I completely
                    redesigned the
                    Visits page to highlight photos. I also realized if they wanted to search quickly, it'd only make
                    sense to include
                    the menu item's ranking on the same page. </p>

                <p><b class="number">2. </b> The thing people want to track most (the menu item they tried) didn't make
                    sense to put on a separate page. Adding the name, picture, and rating of the menu item(s) they tried
                    was the most important thing to testers, so I realized it should be the first thing they are able to
                    enter when they "Spork a
                    visit." They shouldn't have to navigate to a different page to enter these details.

                    Not everyone loves pie charts. Additonally, lists can provide more metrics, so it made sense to

                        <p> After I refining my wireframes, it was time to figure out what the look, feel, and name of
                            the app would be. This was a struggle because I wanted to come up with a name that helped
                            explain what the app did, but also really liked the idea of a short, catchy name.</p>
                        <p>
                            At first I toyed with the names Dinary (a portmanteau of “dining diary”), NomNotes, or Plate
                            Rate. But I found all of these either failed short of encapsulating what my app did, or just
                            didn’t sound very good. When the name Spoke came to me, I initially dismissed it because it
                            said nothing of what the app was for. But then I considered Yelp, Google, and
                            Foursquare--none of which have a title explaining the company’s purpose.</p>
                        <p>
                            So I asked friends for their opinions on what the name should be. Ultimately, we agreed
                            Spork would be a great name for a restaurant app and were all surprised it didn’t exist
                            already. We loved that it worked well to verb-ify as in, “Give me a second. I need to Spork
                            this [restaurant visit].” It also made deciding on a logo a million times easier since the
                            name is a physical object.</p>
                        <p>
                            After experimenting with lots of logos, my final decision was based off of preference tests.

                        <p>
                            For colors, I knew I wanted to use red or yellow both colors often associated with
                            restaurants / food. I chose my dark orange-red because it felt foody and worked well with
                            white type on top of it (a common trend in Material Design, which I used as guidelines for
                            much of my styling). The blue came from experimenting with what went well with red that
                            could be a background to white text. Green felt too Christmas-y.

                    <p><b class="number">2. </b>Just having interesting statistics on the home page wasn't enough. Users
                        wanted widgets on the home page to be interactive, to give them a clear sense of what to do
                        next. I added call to action buttons on each widget and then preference tested whether I should
                        use graphics or photos. While only 55% percent of testers chose photos, their comments convinced
                        me it was the right choice. It matched the rest of the app better and food is such a visual
                        thing anyway. Seeing food photos makes people want to eat.</p><br><br>

                    <p class="after-carousel"><b class="number">3. </b>Having a different view options between a list
                        and pie chart
                        view seemed like the smartest way to make everyone happy in the way data was presented. The
                        biggest questions
                        was what the most intuitive way of switching the views would be. In preference testing three
                        options, I found that
                        76% of testers preferred the toggle beneath the tabs. You can see the new design also features
                        adherence to Material Design guidelines.</p><br>

                        the sections. Sure enough, after preference testing the screens below, I found the majority of
                        users (70%) preferred
                        each
                        section having a colored background as an anchor. About 35% preferred the single lines of
                        background and another 35%
                        preferred the longer colored backgrounds.</p>

                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

                    <div class="conc-p">
                        <p>Besides basic takeaways about how people use apps, I learned a lot from designing Spork that
                            I intend to apply to future design projects:</p>
                        <p> <b class="number">1. </b> It’s worth it to investigate apps that aren’t direct competitors.
                            When doing my competitive analysis I should’ve have looked up other apps that track anything
                            (not just traveling, restaurants, or board games). I found out about Untappd and aTimeLogger
                            after mostly completing the design of my app.</p>
                        <p><b class="number">2. </b>
                            It’s okay to add questions to a survey shortly after it’s been deployed. I added “Photos of
                            meal” as an option after several people had already taken the survey, and still had 59.5% of
                            all respondents (including the initial takers who didn’t see the option) select this
                            feature. If I hadn’t added that option later, I might not have realized until much later,
                            after designing and testing wireframes, how important photos were.</p>
                        <p> <b class="number">3. </b>It’s important to develop more screens than might feel necessary
                            for prototypes, like a blank log-in screen and one that filled out so users understand
                            they’re not actually typing anything. When search fields are included, it’s also important
                            to show users how it would work so you can get feedback on it. </p>
                        <p> <b class="number">4. </b>It’s important to set reminders to check back consistently at user
                            personas. I thought I just remembered everything about them as I was designing, but when I
                            had finished designing, I saw that I was mistaken. One of my personas biggest frustrations
                            was not being able to share his statistics with friends from within the BG Stats app.
                            Fortunately, shareability didn’t come up during the user surveys; it was mentioned only in
                            one user interview. While this is easy to just write off as “not being part of the MVP”,
                            completely forgetting about it showed me the importance of continually checking my design
                            against my personas. </p>
