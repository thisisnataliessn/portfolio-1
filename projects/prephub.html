                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>Current cloud storage services are not streamlined for the kind of organization teachers need to
                    prep for class. Content is spread out in different shared folders, in emailed links, or in unsorted
                    lists of bookmarks in browsers. And with constant curriculum updates, it's hard to know which files
                    are relevant.</p>

            <div class="solution">
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>PrepHub offers teachers a familiar feel for cloud storage while providing more tailored features to
                    meet their needs. It offers teachers a way to centralize all kinds of prep material, to bring
                    relevant material to the top, and to enable password restriction on shareable links.</p>

            <div class="key-takeaways">
                <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
                <p>Based on my user research, I found most teachers already used cloud storage. Therefore, my service
                    would need to feel familiar. However, I found three key ways that cloud storage could be optimized
                    for teachers: <br>

                    1) Add explicit URL saving functionality for teachers to access all their digital prep materials in
                    one place<br>

                    2) Make password saving an obvious choice on the Shareable Link modal window
                </p>
                <p>3) Offer an obvious way to keep relevant files on top, unlike any competitor.<br>

                    a) Sorting files by the “last used” date would allow teachers to group files by dates they taught
                    certain classes, keeping the most relevant files on top. If outdated files from old curriculum
                    remain on the cloud, teachers could look at the “last used” date to avoid time opening several
                    files, hunting for the right one.<br>

                    b) The “last used” date could also be used by administrators of schools/districts to determine what
                    files their teachers are using the most

            <div class="user-personas">
                <h2>User Personas</h2>
                <p>I developed two personas to help encapsulate what specific needs both teachers and administrators
                    had. I used these personas as a reference point to ensure my design was meeting their needs.</p>

                <img>
                <p>Next I created paths for the most important tasks teachers or administrators would need to do. These
                    user flows served as the foundations for my wireframes.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wireframes">
                <h2>Wireframes & Testing</h2>
                <p>With flows in place, I began sketching rough wireframes for PrepHub. After some A/B testing with a
                    design mentor for the landing page, I created hi-fi wireframes using Figma. I turned these into a
                    prototype with InVision and administered user testing both in-person and remotely (via screen
                    sharing on Skype).<br>

                    While most tasks were intuitive, I made several design updates to improve usability. Some of the
                    biggest changes included:
                    .</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Making an ellipsis menu available on every line item on the dashboard, without needing to hover
                        over it</li>
                    <li>Adding a “Used Today” checkbox in every column to make updating the “last used” date easier and
                        more obvious than hiding it in the ellipsis menu</li>
                    <li> Adding names and location for teachers cited in the testimonials, so they seem more
                        real/relatable</li>
                </ol>

            <h1>Branding</h1>
            <div class="identity">
                <h2>Identity Creation</h2>
                <p>Next I created paths for the most important tasks teachers or administrators would need to do. These
                    user flows served as the foundations for my wireframes.</p>
                <img>
                <img>
                <p> I settled on the <b>name</b> PrepHub because “hub” means “the effective center of an activity,
                    region, or network” and I wanted my website to be the effective host/center of all teachers’ prep
                    materials. The logo conveys the hub aspect, with the center apple clearly representing teachers as
                    its intended audience.<br>

                    The <b>color scheme</b> feels like an elementary school environment. I chose Lato as my typeface
                    because it felt contemporary and easy-to-read.<br>

                    My working brand <b>typeface</b> was Oswald, but one user pointed out they would expect an open
                    serif style to go along with the elementary school vibe. Since Lato met those needs and matched the
                    body typeface, it was a shoe-in. To ensure consistency and adherence to these ideas across all
                    parts of the project, I also made a style guide. <br>

                <h2>Preference Testing</h2>
                <p>I wanted to ensure my landing page, the first page people saw, left the best impression, so I did
                    several preference tests on it using UsabilityHub. First I tested photos vs illustrations. But with
                    only a 5% difference, I used comments to determine which was better. Users noted graphics worked
                    better with the logo aesthetics, felt more modern, and photos were too abstract for this scenario.
                    I also tested a few different layout combinations for the testimonials and plans sections.</p>

                <h2>Hi-fi Mockups & Testing</h2>
                <p>Finally, I turned my hi-fi mockups into a prototype on InVision and tested five users, both
                    in-person and remotely. I made the following discoveries from the tests:<br>

                    1) I needed more spacing and color in my left nav bar. <br>

                    2) I needed to clarify the wording in the modal windows for shared links and opening a doc, xls, or
                    ppt in Open Office.<br>
                    3) Some users prefer grid view so I added this view option.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    4) The “Used Today” checkbox was self-explanatory to users, but when asked to enter several dates
                    on which a file was used, users tended to gravitate toward the “Last Used” column. I realized from
                    this I would need a couple changes: <br>
                    a) I implemented a hover state of the “Last Used” title to bring up a small box explaining what it
                    means. <br>
                    b) I would ask development to enable right clicks to open the ellipsis menu wherever clicked, and a
                    double-click in the “Last Used” column to open the “Enter Date(s) Used” modal window.

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <div class="conc">
                <p>PrepHub was a large undertaking, but one with many lessons for me. Going into the project, I was
                    doubtful that I would be able to come up with a strong brand identity since I don’t have a
                    background in art. However, I learned that sketching and mindmapping are extremely valuable
                    brainstorming tools that should not be overlooked. I am extremely pleased with the look of feel of
                    the PrepHub brand, especially its logo and name; it is clean and clearly conveys the site’s
                    audience and purpose.</p>
                <p>Most importantly, PrepHub accomplishes its goal of helping teachers stay organized and spend less
                    time prepping. I based every iteration on feedback from users, including real teachers. As a former
                    teacher myself, I would have loved to have this service available. </p>
                <p>In thinking about further development, I would like more testing participants from my target
                    audience to ensure every detail is as intuitive as possible. Additionally, I believe there is
                    opportunity for PrepHub to create its own teacher-focused creative software (for documents, slide
                    decks, etc.) through further research, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing. /p>
